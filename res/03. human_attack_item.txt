# This run shows that the human-controlled player initiates an attack on the target.

## Here are the three scenarios:
   1. The human-controlled player attacks the target with no other players nearby.
   2. The human-controlled player attacks the target with no pet present but other players nearby.
   3. The human-controlled player attacks the target with a pet present and other players nearby.

### Scenario 1:
I placed Player 1 and Player 2 in non-adjacent locations. When Player 1 attacked the target, it successfully reduced the target’s health.
