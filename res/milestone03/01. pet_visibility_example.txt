This test is to verify that the space containing a pet becomes invisible (in the output, it will show "Pet is here" and the specific information of that space cannot be seen).

The initial location of the pet is the same as that of the target, which is in the place named Park. I set the initial location of the player in the Grocery Store, which is adjacent to Park. When the player uses the "look around" function, the location of Park will display "Pet is here", preventing the player from knowing the detailed information about this location.
