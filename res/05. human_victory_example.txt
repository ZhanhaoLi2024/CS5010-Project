This run shows that the human-controlled player initiates an attack on the target and successfully kills the target.

I set the targetâ€™s health to 10 (so the target would die with a single attack from a player using an item). Player 1 picked up the Shopping Cart (which deals 12 damage) on the first turn and, with no one nearby on the second turn, attacked the target, successfully killing it.
