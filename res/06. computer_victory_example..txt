This run shows that the computer-controlled player initiates an attack on the target and successfully kills the target.

I set the game to 1000 turns and added two computer-controlled players. By the 148th turn, computer-1 used an item to attack the target, dealing 15 points of damage and killing the target, thus winning the game.
